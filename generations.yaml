    description: "The original Volkswagen e-Golf represented the brand's first mainstream all-electric passenger vehicle, based on the seventh-generation Golf (MQB platform). Powered by an 85 kW (115 hp) electric motor driving the front wheels and a 24.2 kWh lithium-ion battery providing approximately 83 miles of EPA-rated range, the e-Golf was visually nearly identical to the standard Golf apart from model-specific LED daytime running lights, subtle blue accents, unique wheels, and the absence of exhaust pipes. DC fast charging capability was available at 40 kW via the Combined Charging System (CCS), allowing an 80% charge in approximately 30 minutes. The interior maintained the high-quality design and materials of the standard Golf while adding electric-specific displays, blue accent stitching, and a modified instrument cluster showing power flow, regenerative braking levels, and remaining range. Regenerative braking could be adjusted through multiple levels using the shift paddles. Standard features included LED headlights, heated seats, and Car-Net connected services with specific EV functions like remote charging control and climate pre-conditioning. Production began in March 2014 for European markets, with U.S. sales starting in November 2014 for the 2015 model year."

  - name: "First Generation (Mk7.5 Facelift)"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The facelifted e-Golf (Mk7.5) received significant updates including a larger 35.8 kWh lithium-ion battery increasing EPA-rated range to approximately 125 miles, and a more powerful 100 kW (134 hp) electric motor improving acceleration from 0-60 mph to approximately 9.6 seconds. The onboard charger was upgraded to accept AC power at up to 7.2 kW as standard, while DC fast charging capability was made standard on higher trims. Visually, the facelift featured updated headlights with full LED technology as standard across the range, revised front and rear bumpers, and an enlarged infotainment touchscreen with enhanced connectivity options. The e-Golf was the last hatchback version of the Golf Mk7 produced in Europe, with production continuing until late December 2020 due to high demand, well after other powertrain variants which were discontinued in 2019. The successor ID.3 took over the e-Golf's Transparent Factory production line in Dresden starting at the end of January 2021."
