    description: "The Volkswagen e-Golf represented the brand's first mainstream all-electric passenger vehicle, based on the seventh-generation Golf (MQB platform) but replacing the conventional powertrain with an electric drive system. Visually nearly identical to the standard Golf apart from model-specific LED daytime running lights, subtle blue accents, unique wheels, and of course the absence of exhaust pipes, the e-Golf followed Volkswagen's strategy of offering alternative powertrains within established model lines rather than developing dedicated electric vehicles—an approach later abandoned with the ID series. Initially powered by an 85 kW (115 hp) electric motor driving the front wheels and a 24.2 kWh lithium-ion battery providing approximately 83 miles of EPA-rated range, the e-Golf received a significant update in 2017 with an enhanced 100 kW (134 hp) motor and larger 35.8 kWh battery increasing range to about 125 miles—still modest by later standards but competitive when introduced. DC fast charging capability was available, initially at 40 kW and later improved to 50 kW, allowing an 80% charge in approximately 30 minutes at compatible stations. The interior maintained the high-quality design and materials of the standard Golf while adding electric-specific displays, blue accent stitching, and a modified instrument cluster showing power flow, regenerative braking levels, and remaining range. Regenerative braking could be adjusted through multiple levels using the shift paddles, allowing for customized one-pedal driving experience depending on conditions and driver preference. Standard features were generous, reflecting the e-Golf's position near the top of the Golf lineup, with most models including LED headlights, heated seats, DC fast charging capability, and Volkswagen's Car-Net connected services with specific EV functions like remote charging control and climate pre-conditioning. Performance was respectable with 0-60 mph acceleration in approximately 9 seconds (later improved to around 8.5 seconds with the enhanced motor), though with a focus on efficiency rather than outright speed. The e-Golf served as Volkswagen's transitional electric vehicle, allowing the company to gain experience with EV technology and market response while developing the dedicated MEB platform that would underpin the subsequent ID lineup, with production ending in 2020 as the ID.3 (the effective electric successor to the Golf) began rolling off assembly lines."
